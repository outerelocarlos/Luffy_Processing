# Luffy rendering with Processing

Processing script that renders Luffy (the main protagonist of the One Piece manganime series) using shapes, curves and other mathematical expressions.

Processing scripts are built around a never-ending loop that is drawn a certain number of times per second, which is an interesting scripting exercise in and of itself.
